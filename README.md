## About This Simple Book Management System

to build this simple system we need two entities, 
Book(name, author, quantity, date_of_production, description, number_of_pages) And 
Image(book_id, file_name, path, url, size).
where each book has one cover image,
also we need to control book, a page to list them all, page to add book, page to edit book
page to view book details and delete it.
we will use php with laravel to function this system, and use laravel blade for the interfaces with css and javascript.
mysql database for storing books informations.
